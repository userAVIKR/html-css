            <pre> 
                Wise men say
                Only fools, only fools rush in
                Oh, but I, but I, I can't help falling in love with you
                
                Shall I stay?
                Would it be, would it be a sin?
                If I can't help falling in love with you
                
                Like a river flows
                Surely to the sea
                Darling, so it goes
                Some things, you know, are meant to be
                
                Take my hand
                Take my whole life too
                For I can"t help falling in love with you
                For I can"t help falling in love with you
                Yeah</pre>
